Project: XOR gate using backpropagation algorithm
Author: Michail - Panagiotis Bofos AO082689

Note: if you have Python and pyplot installed the program will create its own error/epoch and success/epoch plots, anyhow the requested files will still be created.

Instructions: 

    Windows: 
            1) javac *.java
            2) java Network parameters.txt

    Unix/Linux:
            1) Run runXOR.sh parameters.txt - or - runXOR.sh parameters.txt -C [if you want to clean up the .class files created]
